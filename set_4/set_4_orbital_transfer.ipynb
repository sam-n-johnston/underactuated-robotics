A different example is provided by the single legged hopper part of this problem set, which is a implemented as a Drake system (inherits from `VectorSystem`) and uses Drake to do the simulation by brining in the robot model from an `.sdf` description.\n",

Shooting might work OK with \"autodiff\" gradients, but Direct Transcription should work well with symbolic gradients for a problem of this size(and autodiff too), and it's a good learning opportunity to do this way."

At this time of writing, Drake's own trajectory optimization can be called from pydrake, but only for systems which have been implemented in C++ (see the acrobot, cartpole, pendulum examples in the textbook).  By this time next week or two, though, it will be possible to call pydrake's own trajectory optimization from Python-implemented classes.\n",
