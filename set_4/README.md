# Project

## Project proposal

Create a 3d hopper similar to this [one](http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/3D_hopper/3D_hopper.html) and be able to control it's (x,y) position & speed while maintaining jumping height. It should also be able to control it's hopping height. 

Other phases of things I could do later:
- Make it do flips
- Add uncertainty in the robot's feedback loop to reflex the real world
- Create the robot in the real world
